# Bioinformatics Lab Exercises

This repository contains lab work from the "Introduction to Bioinformatics" course, 
organized into two categories: labs conducted during [lectures](lecture-based_labs/README.md) 
and labs conducted during workshops/seminars. 
Each folder contains a README file with specific details on the corresponding lab tasks.
